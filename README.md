Kilt
====

Over the years, we've been working to develop the interface you see and use everyday. We hope assembling and documenting our most common patterns will improve our usersâ€™ experience, strengthen consistency within our product, speed up our creative process and simplify the dialogue between designers and developers.

The iAdvize design system kit is also a way to onboard new designers and developers by giving them all the tools they need to grow and create.

Kilt is a living style guide, like us, it'll adapt, learn and change.
